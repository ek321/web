  <h2>Mitosis</h2>

      <p>Mitosis is the process of a cell splitting into two genetically identical cells. Mitosis has five steps: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. 
      When the cell starts mitosis, it has already replicated its DNA and its organelles in interphase. In prophase, the DNA starts to condense again as the nucleus 
      dissolves and the spindle fibers start to form. In prometaphase, a phase between prophase and metaphase, the spindle fibers push the chromosomes towards the center. In metaphase,
      the chromosomes are all lined up in the center of the cell. In anaphase, the spindle fibers pull sister chromatids to opposite ends of the cell. Kinetochores, which
      are attached to the sister chromatids, pull them to opposite ends by breaking down the spindle fibers and pulling the chromatids along. In telophase, spindle fibers
      disappear, and the chromosomes start to decondense as the nucleus reforms. In cytokinesis, the cleavage furrow or the cell plate, depending on whether the cell is an
      animal cell or a plant cell, forms in the middle of the cell and the cell splits into two identical daughter cells and they go back into the cell cycle. In the cell
      cycle, there are checkpoints that check for any errors in the cell. If a cell fails to meet the checkpoint, then the cell tries to fix the error and continue along 
      the cell cycle. However, if the cell fails to fix the error, the cell may go into apoptosis, which is when the cell dies. To learn more about these checkpoints, click

      <p>Meiosis is a similar process to mitosis, except it goes through the splitting process twice, and to do so, there are some changes that occur in the process. One of 
        the main differences between meiosis and mitosis is that the resulting daughter cells are genetically different from each other and the parent cell in meiosis, while
        they are identical in mitosis. This is because of crossing over that switches up the alleles between homologous chromosomes. This results in genetically different 
        chromosomes in each of the daughter cells. It is because of this process that a child does not look exactly like their parents. Mitosis creates somatic (body) cells, 
        while meiosis creates gametes (cells for reproduction). In addition, the daughter cells produced from meiosis are haploid cells, which cells from mitosis are diploid. 
        Haploid cells have half the regular amount of chromosomes, while diploid cells have the regular amount of chromosomes. Furthermore, there are 4 daughter cells produced 
        during meiosis, while there is only 2 in mitosis. However, when producing an egg, 3 of the 4 daughter cells are polar bodies, which is a result of 1 of the daughter 
        cells having the majority of the cytoplasm. So, technically, only 1 egg is produced during meiosis, but 4 daughter cells are produced in total. These are some of the 
        ways meiosis and mitosis differ, although the process is similar.</p>
