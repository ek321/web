      <p>Mitosis is the process of a cell splitting into two genetically identical cells. Mitosis has five steps: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. 
      When the cell starts mitosis, it has already replicated its DNA and its organelles in interphase. In prophase, the DNA starts to condense again as the nucleus 
      dissolves and the spindle fibers start to form. In prometaphase, a phase between prophase and metaphase, the spindle fibers push the chromosomes towards the center. In metaphase,
      the chromosomes are all lined up in the center of the cell. In anaphase, the spindle fibers pull sister chromatids to opposite ends of the cell. Kinetochores, which
      are attached to the sister chromatids, pull them to opposite ends by breaking down the spindle fibers and pulling the chromatids along. In telophase, spindle fibers
      disappear, and the chromosomes start to decondense as the nucleus reforms. In cytokinesis, the cleavage furrow or the cell plate, depending on whether the cell is an
      animal cell or a plant cell, forms in the middle of the cell and the cell splits into two identical daughter cells and they go back into the cell cycle. In the cell
      cycle, there are checkpoints that check for any errors in the cell. If a cell fails to meet the checkpoint, then the cell tries to fix the error and continue along 
      the cell cycle. However, if the cell fails to fix the error, the cell may go into apoptosis, which is when the cell dies. To learn more about these checkpoints, click
