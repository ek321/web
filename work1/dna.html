    <p>DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and it holds all the instructions necessary for a living organism to function.
      DNA is found inside the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, but for a prokaryote, it is found in the cytoplasm. DNA is in the shape of
      a double helix, with a pentose sugar and a phosphate as the sides of the "ladder" and the nitrogenous bases as the "rungs". There are four nitrogenous
      bases: adenine(A), thymine(T), guanine(G), and cytosine(C). A and G are purines, while T and C are pyrimidines, and opposites go together. A pairs with T, while
      C pairs with G. A and T are bonded by two hydrogen bonds, while C and G are bonded by three hydrogen bonds, so C and G have a strong bond than A and T. When 
      undergoing mitosis, DNA replication happens in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. DNA replication is a complex process with many enzymes working 
      together to copy DNA with the least amount of mistakes possible. To learn about DNA replication, click the link below.</p>
