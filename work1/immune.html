      <p>The immune system is a complex network of cells that communicate with each other to fend off the body from foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The
      white blood cells, aka leukocytes, are the main cells that fight off pathogens. Phagocytes are one of the first white blood cells that help fight against bacteria 
      that have penetrated through the first line of defense, or in other words, the innate immunity, by swallowing them and breaking them down. Innate immunity is 
      immunity that a person is born with, such as skin, sweat, tears, and mucus. Another type of white blood cells are the lymphocytes. There are two kinds, B cells and 
      T cells. Specific B cells will become active and produce specific antibodies that will help fight against a specific type of pathogen. Other B cells become memory 
      B cells that will remember the antigens on the specific pathogen, just in case the body is infected with the same pathogen at a later point in time. T cells are killer 
      cells that will kill infected cells. Like B cells, they are also specific and specific T cells will be activated according to the type of pathogen that enters the body.
      The immune system is a complex system, which means there are times when things go wrong. There can be problems with the immune system, and to learn more about them
