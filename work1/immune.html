    <h2>Immune System</h2>
      <img src="https://www.omsusa.org/cellsis.jpg" height="300px">
      <p>The immune system is a complex network of cells that communicate with each other to fend off the body from foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The
      white blood cells, aka leukocytes, are the main cells that fight off pathogens. Phagocytes are one of the first white blood cells that help fight against bacteria 
      that have penetrated through the first line of defense, or in other words, the innate immunity, by swallowing them and breaking them down. Innate immunity is 
      immunity that a person is born with, such as skin, sweat, tears, and mucus. Another type of white blood cells are the lymphocytes. There are two kinds, B cells and 
      T cells. Specific B cells will become active and produce specific antibodies that will help fight against a specific type of pathogen. Other B cells become memory 
      B cells that will remember the antigens on the specific pathogen, just in case the body is infected with the same pathogen at a later point in time. T cells are killer 
      cells that will kill infected cells. Like B cells, they are also specific and specific T cells will be activated according to the type of pathogen that enters the body.
      The immune system is a complex system, which means there are times when things go wrong. There can be problems with the immune system, and to learn more about them

      <p>Allergies occur when a person's immune system identifies a harmless foreign substance as dangerous. The immune system attacks it as if it is an intruding pathogen, 
        so to put it simply, the immune system regards the substance as harmful and attacks. People with pollen allergy have immune systems that regard pollen as a pathogen 
        and attacks, initiating the immune response. Histamines are the chemicals that are released by mast cells where an injure has occured to dialte blood vessels in 
        order to lower blood pressure and increase permeability. This also causes the inflammatory response, which causing swelling. Immune cells release pyrogens to get the 
        hypothalamus to increase the temperature in the body, causing a fever. This fever is used to try to kill bacteria and to make the immune response more efficient as 
        some parts of the immmune system function better at higher temperatures.
