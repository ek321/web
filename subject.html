    <h2>DNA</h2>

      <p>DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and it holds all the instructions necessary for a living organism to function.
      DNA is found inside the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, but for a prokaryote, it is found in the cytoplasm. DNA is in the shape of
      a double helix, with a pentose sugar and a phosphate as the sides of the "ladder" and the nitrogenous bases as the "rungs". There are four nitrogenous
      bases: adenine(A), thymine(T), guanine(G), and cytosine(C). A and G are purines, while T and C are pyrimidines, and opposites go together. A pairs with T, while
      C pairs with G. A and T are bonded by two hydrogen bonds, while C and G are bonded by three hydrogen bonds, so C and G have a strong bond than A and T. When 
      undergoing mitosis, DNA replication happens in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. DNA replication is a complex process with many enzymes working 
      together to copy DNA with the least amount of mistakes possible. To learn about DNA replication, click the link below.</p>

    <h2>Immune System</h2>
      <img src="https://www.omsusa.org/cellsis.jpg">
      <p>The immune system is a complex network of cells that communicate with each other to fend off the body from foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The
      white blood cells, aka leukocytes, are the main cells that fight off pathogens. Phagocytes are one of the first white blood cells that help fight against bacteria 
      that have penetrated through the first line of defense, or in other words, the innate immunity, by swallowing them and breaking them down. Innate immunity is 
      immunity that a person is born with, such as skin, sweat, tears, and mucus. Another type of white blood cells are the lymphocytes. There are two kinds, B cells and 
      T cells. Specific B cells will become active and produce specific antibodies that will help fight against a specific type of pathogen. Other B cells become memory 
      B cells that will remember the antigens on the specific pathogen, just in case the body is infected with the same pathogen at a later point in time. T cells are killer 
      cells that will kill infected cells. Like B cells, they are also specific and specific T cells will be activated according to the type of pathogen that enters the body.
      The immune system is a complex system, which means there are times when things go wrong. There can be problems with the immune system, and to learn more about them

    <h2>Mitosis</h2>
      <img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/animal-cell-mitosis-illustration-chromosomes-260nw-1539718535.jpg">
      <p>Mitosis is the process of a cell splitting into two genetically identical cells. Mitosis has five steps: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. 
      When the cell starts mitosis, it has already replicated its DNA and its organelles in interphase. In prophase, the DNA starts to condense again as the nucleus 
      dissolves and the spindle fibers start to form. In prometaphase, a phase between prophase and metaphase, the spindle fibers push the chromosomes towards the center. In metaphase,
      the chromosomes are all lined up in the center of the cell. In anaphase, the spindle fibers pull sister chromatids to opposite ends of the cell. Kinetochores, which
      are attached to the sister chromatids, pull them to opposite ends by breaking down the spindle fibers and pulling the chromatids along. In telophase, spindle fibers
      disappear, and the chromosomes start to decondense as the nucleus reforms. In cytokinesis, the cleavage furrow or the cell plate, depending on whether the cell is an
      animal cell or a plant cell, forms in the middle of the cell and the cell splits into two identical daughter cells and they go back into the cell cycle. In the cell
      cycle, there are checkpoints that check for any errors in the cell. If a cell fails to meet the checkpoint, then the cell tries to fix the error and continue along 
      the cell cycle. However, if the cell fails to fix the error, the cell may go into apoptosis, which is when the cell dies. To learn more about these checkpoints, click 
      the link below.</p>
