    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This site is a collection of random short explanations about topics in biology. This is not an extensive explanation for any biological process, but a short
      explanation. Biology is very complex as many things depend on something else to create a working system. In a cell, for example, has many different organelles
	  that have different functions that contribute to the cell's survival, but create a living system on its own. A body is composed of different organs that keep
	  the body functioning, but a liver on its own can't produce a living human. Biology also includes the environment of living things. In an ecosystem, the
	  various connections between one living thing and another creates a balanced system that prevents one group from growing too big, like the connection between
	  prey and predator. Biology is the study of living organisms and even the a small bacteria is full of complexity as many parts fit together to create a working
	  machine.</p>
