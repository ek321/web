    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Escape rooms are extremely entertaining because it makes your mind 
	work to piece together the various clues provided in order to escape.
	However, in our current situation, we are not able to freely go outside 
	to have fun, so we decided to make a virutal escape room. Our escape room 
	is a text based adventure, where the player interacts with the environment 
	through text. This aspect of the escape room causes the game to be more 
	like a story than an escape room, however, the interactive feature makes 
	it engaging as the player is able to take part in the story. We used 
	python to make the game and we used various skills we had learned to make 
	the game. A lot of effort went into the game, so we hope you enjoy the virtual escape room!
	</p>
	
	<h2>How To Play</h2>
	<p>The game will describe various scenarios and the player will be prompted 
	to answer a yes or no quesion. The player will enter yes or no based on what 
	they believe is the best decision to make. Based on the player's response, 
	the game will describe the next scene. A warning to keep in mind is that there 
	are decisions that can lead to a game over, so choose wisely. Lastly, there 
	may be times when you need to use the internet, so feel free to do so. Have fun!
